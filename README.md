# Crypto / Coin Price Scraper-API & WebApp

## Problem Statement 

In the current world of evolving crypto currencies, coin prices fluctuate rapidly across different exchanges. Traders and investors  often struggle to:
   - Monitor multiple coins in real time,
   - Compare coin performance over time, 
   - Get real time alerts when prices spike &
   - Analyze coin behavior with historical trends.  

To many, these tasks are trivial, but they often require users to visit multiple sites using third-party platforms with limited free access or with written scripts, which is time consuming, technical or costly.  

## Solution 

1. Project Overview
Developing a scalable webApp Crypto/ Coin Price Scraper API tool designed to scrape:
   - Real-time price data of determined cryptocurrecies from multiple sources,   
   - market cap 
   - trading volumes &
   - Provide currency exchange rates and comparisons in visualized data.

The tool will allow users to compare different coins based on performance. It will also notify users by (email/sms) by sending alerts and analytics insights based on user-defined preferences and when a user's preferred coin hits a specified threshold. 

In Summary: The CoinScraper tool wil simplify the crypto market monitorig and insights extraction for individual users, saving their time, reducing on paid tools and enabling smarter decisions.
